The Keplr browser extension is a wallet for accessing applications in the Cosmos ecosystem and managing user identities. It can be used to connect to {{ $themeConfig.project.name }} through the official testnet and request Funds from the Faucet.

## Install Keplr

Add the Keplr browser extension following the instructions on the [Keplr website](https://www.keplr.app/). The Keplr extension is officially supported only on Chromium-based explorers.

## Create/Import Account

Open the Keplr extension on your browser. If you are setting up Keplr for the first time, you can either create a new account or import an existing account. Refer to the [Keplr documentation](https://keplr.crunch.help/getting-started) for further information.

## Connect to Haqq Testnet and Request Funds from the Faucet

üöß `In developing...` üèó

View your account balance either by clicking on the Keplr extension or by [interacting with the node](../../quickstart/interact_node.md). Note that Faucet might not display the amount of {{ $themeConfig.project.testnet_denom }} transferred by the Faucet, as it might be smaller than the number of decimals displayed in the Keplr extension.
